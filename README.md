Course content of Storytelling with Data


## Storytelling Arc

All great stories follow the same structure in 5 stages

1) Exposition - Introduce the audience to the scene, the characters, the the basic plot  
2) Rising Action - This is where the story build tension and suspense/conflict indicating something exciting will happen  
3) Climax - Pinnacle of the story, important event or plot twist. It is something special and memorable  
4) Falling Action - Climax is over but the story isn't finished. Loose ends to tie up, mysteries to explain and character development needs to be apparent as a result of the climax  
5) Resolution - Conclusion of the story/ Cliffhanger that sets you up for the next part or the sequel  

Compare this to the data

* **Exposition**: Depending on the complexity of the data to be shown this stage could be really fast or it might take several minutes.
    * What is the purpose and origin of the data 
    * How were they collected or processed or analyzed.
    * What questions are the data relevant for and why are they important for the audience.
    * What kind of visual representation should be shown like charts or graphs or line plots.
    * What should the audience be looking for.



## Big picture first, Details as appropriate

As soon as you show a graph, remind the audience of 
* The main purpose of the data
* Interpret the axis or the colors
* Direct attention to the relevant data
