Course content of Storytelling with Data


## Storytelling Arc

All great stories follow the same structure in 5 stages

1) Exposition - Introduce the audience to the scene, the characters, the the basic plot  
2) Rising Action - This is where the story build tension and suspense/conflict indicating something exciting will happen  
3) Climax - Pinnacle of the story, important event or plot twist. It is something special and memorable  
4) Falling Action - Climax is over but the story isn't finished. Loose ends to tie up, mysteries to explain and character development needs to be apparent as a result of the climax  
5) Resolution - Conclusion of the story/ Cliffhanger that sets you up for the next part or the sequel  

Compare this to the data

* **Exposition**: Depending on the complexity of the data to be shown this stage could be really fast or it might take several minutes.
    * What is the purpose and origin of the data 
    * How were they collected or processed or analyzed.
    * What questions are the data relevant for and why are they important for the audience.
    * What kind of visual representation should be shown like charts or graphs or line plots.
    * What should the audience be looking for.

* **Rising Action**: Here you want to get your audience excited about the data so don't just tell themthe key finding, instead build it up to generate excitement.There are a few different ways that you can do this. Depending on how you are presenting the data and depending on your audience you can just ask them to predict what they think will happen or you can tell them how important and interesting the finding is before telling them the actual results.

* **Climax** :  This is the part where you explain the key finding that is the most important result from the data that your audience should remember.

* **Falling Action** : This is where you provide additional details about the data that are maybe a little bit less exciting but still important enough to discuss. So it's like a preliminary analysis and you need to let your audience know that the results may change with more data

* **Resolution** : The resolution should contain three statements 
   * Summary of the key results.
   * Summary of the importance or the implications of those results.
   * Statement about what courses of action or decisions should be made based on the results. 

This last statement could be a change in business strategy or a policy recommendation or it could simply be an inspiration for additional data to be collected.


## Know your audience

The way that you tell a story with data depends to a large extent on who your audiences. You don't always know who will be sitting in your audience but sometimes you do or sometimes you might at least have an idea of who most of your audience will be if possible you should always try to find out as much as you can about your audience. That's because the appropriate strategies for presenting your data and telling a story about your data in particular how much detail you go into depends strongly on who your audience is.

Too much detail or technical specifications might make the investors concern that you don't understand the big picture and you're just obsessed with little details without seeing the potential of your own work.

If you are unsure about the level of relevant expertise in your audience then it's best to assume that your audience is intelligent curious interested and open minded but that they don't have the background to get all of the fine grained details about exactly how the data were acquired and processed and analyzed.Therefore you should tell a story about your data that is understandable to non experts but at the same time you should be prepared to discuss the technical details in case someone knows the field and will ask those kinds of questions.

This balance can be a little bit difficult to find because on the one hand you want to convince your audience that you have the right expertise. But on the other hand you don't want to alienate the audience and make them feel left out.

Most importantly don't sound like you are talking down to your audience or insulting them. So you shouldn't say something like I could go into all the details but you wouldn't get it.Instead you could say something like "there are many important details that I'm not going into right now because I don't want this presentation to take too long. But I'm happy to discuss the details later".

If anyone has specific questions this lets your audience know that you care about them and you know how to get the important points out without getting lost in the details. And at the same time you are ready to discuss those details if necessary.



## Big picture first, Details as appropriate

As soon as you show a graph, remind the audience of 
* The main purpose of the data
* Interpret the axis or the colors
* Direct attention to the relevant data
