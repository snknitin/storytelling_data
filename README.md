Course content of Storytelling with Data


## Storytelling Arc

All great stories follow the same structure in 5 stages

1) Exposition - Introduce the audience to the scene, the characters, the the basic plot  
2) Rising Action - This is where the story build tension and suspense/conflict indicating something exciting will happen  
3) Climax - Pinnacle of the story, important event or plot twist. It is something special and memorable  
4) Falling Action - Climax is over but the story isn't finished. Loose ends to tie up, mysteries to explain and character development needs to be apparent as a result of the climax  
5) Resolution - Conclusion of the story/ Cliffhanger that sets you up for the next part or the sequel  

Compare this to the data

* **Exposition**: Depending on the complexity of the data to be shown this stage could be really fast or it might take several minutes.
    * What is the purpose and origin of the data 
    * How were they collected or processed or analyzed.
    * What questions are the data relevant for and why are they important for the audience.
    * What kind of visual representation should be shown like charts or graphs or line plots.
    * What should the audience be looking for.

* **Rising Action**: Here you want to get your audience excited about the data so don't just tell themthe key finding, instead build it up to generate excitement.There are a few different ways that you can do this. Depending on how you are presenting the data and depending on your audience you can just ask them to predict what they think will happen or you can tell them how important and interesting the finding is before telling them the actual results.

* **Climax** :  This is the part where you explain the key finding that is the most important result from the data that your audience should remember.

* **Falling Action** : This is where you provide additional details about the data that are maybe a little bit less exciting but still important enough to discuss. So it's like a preliminary analysis and you need to let your audience know that the results may change with more data

* **Resolution** : The resolution should contain three statements 
   * Summary of the key results.
   * Summary of the importance or the implications of those results.
   * Statement about what courses of action or decisions should be made based on the results. 

This last statement could be a change in business strategy or a policy recommendation or it could simply be an inspiration for additional data to be collected.


## Big picture first, Details as appropriate

As soon as you show a graph, remind the audience of 
* The main purpose of the data
* Interpret the axis or the colors
* Direct attention to the relevant data
