## Storytelling Arc

All great stories follow the same structure in 5 stages

1) Exposition - Introduce the audience to the scene, the characters, the the basic plot  
2) Rising Action - This is where the story build tension and suspense/conflict indicating something exciting will happen  
3) Climax - Pinnacle of the story, important event or plot twist. It is something special and memorable  
4) Falling Action - Climax is over but the story isn't finished. Loose ends to tie up, mysteries to explain and character development needs to be apparent as a result of the climax  
5) Resolution - Conclusion of the story/ Cliffhanger that sets you up for the next part or the sequel  

Compare this to the data

* **Exposition**: Depending on the complexity of the data to be shown this stage could be really fast or it might take several minutes.
    * What is the purpose and origin of the data 
    * How were they collected or processed or analyzed.
    * What questions are the data relevant for and why are they important for the audience.
    * What kind of visual representation should be shown like charts or graphs or line plots.
    * What should the audience be looking for.

* **Rising Action**: Here you want to get your audience excited about the data so don't just tell themthe key finding, instead build it up to generate excitement.There are a few different ways that you can do this. Depending on how you are presenting the data and depending on your audience you can just ask them to predict what they think will happen or you can tell them how important and interesting the finding is before telling them the actual results.

* **Climax** :  This is the part where you explain the key finding that is the most important result from the data that your audience should remember.

* **Falling Action** : This is where you provide additional details about the data that are maybe a little bit less exciting but still important enough to discuss. So it's like a preliminary analysis and you need to let your audience know that the results may change with more data

* **Resolution** : The resolution should contain three statements 
   * Summary of the key results.
   * Summary of the importance or the implications of those results.
   * Statement about what courses of action or decisions should be made based on the results. 

This last statement could be a change in business strategy or a policy recommendation or it could simply be an inspiration for additional data to be collected.


## Know your audience

The way that you tell a story with data depends to a large extent on who your audiences. You don't always know who will be sitting in your audience but sometimes you do or sometimes you might at least have an idea of who most of your audience will be if possible you should always try to find out as much as you can about your audience. That's because the appropriate strategies for presenting your data and telling a story about your data in particular how much detail you go into depends strongly on who your audience is.

Too much detail or technical specifications might make the investors concern that you don't understand the big picture and you're just obsessed with little details without seeing the potential of your own work.

If you are unsure about the level of relevant expertise in your audience then it's best to assume that your audience is intelligent curious interested and open minded but that they don't have the background to get all of the fine grained details about exactly how the data were acquired and processed and analyzed.Therefore you should tell a story about your data that is understandable to non experts but at the same time you should be prepared to discuss the technical details in case someone knows the field and will ask those kinds of questions.

This balance can be a little bit difficult to find because on the one hand you want to convince your audience that you have the right expertise. But on the other hand you don't want to alienate the audience and make them feel left out.

Most importantly don't sound like you are talking down to your audience or insulting them. So you shouldn't say something like I could go into all the details but you wouldn't get it.Instead you could say something like "there are many important details that I'm not going into right now because I don't want this presentation to take too long. But I'm happy to discuss the details later".

If anyone has specific questions this lets your audience know that you care about them and you know how to get the important points out without getting lost in the details. And at the same time you are ready to discuss those details if necessary.



## Audience participation

The importance of audience engagement cannot be understated and it's your job to make sure that the audience is interested and is following along and paying attention. There is one guaranteed method that will make sure your audience is engaged and that is to encourage audience participation. 

* Sometimes this means letting the audience know in the beginning of your presentation that they are free to interrupt with questions or suggestions or discussion points. But if you really want audience participation then you have to stop your presentation and specifically ask if there are comments or questions.

Stopping in the middle of your presentation to ask for audience participation is a high risk high reward endeavor. If it works well and you can pull it off it's an amazing tool to give an unforgettable engaging and interesting presentation asking the audience to participate in your presentation will recapture their attention if they start mind wandering or thinking about something else or just become disengaged from the presentation. It's perfectly natural. Everyone disengages from a presentation. Everyone has mind wandering experiences because it's a natural part of giving a presentation rather than trying to fight against it or ignore you can try to work with it by asking your audience to participate in your presentation. The reason why audience participation can work so well is that it can build conflict and suspense during the rising action stage.

Imagine for example that you ask the audience to guess what results they think you are going to show. You might get different answers or maybe some additional questions and someone might guess it right and someone else might get it wrong and then everyone in the audience is going to want to know who is right and who is wrong and therefore everyone in the audience is all of a sudden going to be paying attention. 

* In this situation you have to be careful not to insult or make fun of the person who guessed wrong. The best way to deal with it is to tell them they had good reasoning and it was a good guess. Maybe you also thought exactly what they thought and you were as surprised as they are to have learned that the data show the opposite pattern.

* On the other hand if you have an audience that is shy or quiet or otherwise not participating then it can be a little bit uncomfortable to wait for audience participation. One way to deal with this situation where you are encouraging and asking for participation but you're not getting it is to change the instructions and tell them that everyone should make a guess in their mind but not say it out loud. 

* Another important consideration for audience participation is that it can add to the total presentation time. If you have many people who want to offer their opinion or ask a question then on the one hand it's a good sign. It means that the audience is engaged in your presentation but on the other hand if you have some talkative people in the audience they might go on and on and on and take time away from your presentation and you don't want to be rude and interrupt someone while they are participating. After you told them that they should participate so audience participation is not always appropriate and is not always possible. It can be a powerful tool for engaging your audience but it could also backfire. This might be something you want to try only in more informal settings or perhaps after you have gained more experience with storytelling with data and you feel more comfortable about changing the presentation on the fly based on how things are going with the audience. 



## Making Visual Graphics

If you cannot spend at least a few minutes thinking about and making the graph look nice then the message you are sending to your audience is that you've rushed through making the visualization and you paid no attention to details or how the information will be seen and interpreted by your audience.

In contrast if the data graphic looks really beautiful but doesn't convey any information or makes it really difficult to extract the information then the message that you are sending is that you are hiding the data or you're embarrassed by the data or that you are so focused by the visual appearance that you don't care about what the data actually show.Or maybe the audience will think that you have no idea what the data mean and you're just trying to distract them with pretty pictures.

Keep in mind that the purpose of data visualization is to convey information.Ideally the visualization should also be beautiful it should be aesthetic and nice to look at but the aesthetic quality is of secondary importance to the information content.

## Plots

* First up is line plots **line plots are often used to show how something changes over time or over space or across different groups.**
The main thing to keep in mind about line plots is that you are making an assumption with line plots that you know what the values would be at the data points between the time points that you have actually measured. So for example in a line plot each of the points here corresponds to an actual measured data point. And the lines are just drawn between them. Now by drawing these lines you are making the assumption that for example the data value at this point here corresponds to this y axis value. But this is really just a guess. If you don't actually have any measured data at this point sometimes line plots are used when they shouldn't be.

   * For Example : a plot showing the number of people with a certain name in some class. Now there's nothing wrong with these boxes per se, those are fine but the lines drawn in between them are in this case a little bit awkward because you're making an assumption that if you would measure in between Mohammad and Mary you would get six individuals a count of six. But that doesn't make any sense because these different names are discrete. There's no smooth transition between John and Mohammed for example.

So make sure that when you're using line plots it is reasonable to assume that there could be data in between these two points. Even if you haven't measured data there.

* **Bar plots are quite common and they're often clear and easy to read.** The main thing to think about with bar plots or really any kind of plots is to use appropriate access ranges. The point is not to show the bar. The point is to show the differences between the groups of bars. 


**Big picture first, Details as appropriate**

As soon as you show a graph, remind the audience of 
* The main purpose of the data
* Interpret the axis or the colors
* Direct attention to the relevant data
